## Stack: Python + pip ‚ú®
```
py -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 --version
```

## Modules ‚ú®
```
pip install requests
pip install lxml
pip install bs4
```

## Usage ‚ú®
- Interactive (Main program to execute and interact through console)
- Non Interactive (Set of scripts with predefined options to process requests)

## Non Interactive Mode ‚ú®
```
./WebScrapURL.py
- Options: 1,2,3 / 1,2,3 (Look interactive)
```

## Interactive Mode Flow ‚ú®

### 1. Start the Interface
```
./WebScrapBRO.py
```

## 2. Interface: First Argument ‚ú®

- At first, user will be engaged with the interface to follow some instructions.
- The program will print a Welcome Message and show a list of options to work with. 
- User will be asked to select one of this options equivalent to a technology he/she is looking to work with.
- The program will wait until user enter the correct int option to continue flow.
- The options are show numerical commands and it could be selected with an int.
```
1. Python
2. SQL
3. Javascript
```
## 3. Interface: Second Argument ‚ú®

- The user will be asked to prompt an option to choose the URL from which he/she wants to get information.

## 4. Backend: Data Checkers ‚ú®

- App will verify the option selected and evaluate: if it's good, to continue app flow. If not, error message will be returned.
- Once option selection is completed, it will build a URL request with the options given as arguments.
- The request will be sent to web and app will wait for response.
- If URL not available/not responding, or anything fails, a new error message will be returned.
- If URL response, the app will load the HTML returned and parse it to XML.
- Next, app will evaluate the parsed XML, to detect the structure and to select a Scrapping Engine.
- If XML structure doesn't match with Engine Config, it will throw an Error message through Console.
- If the XML is good, it will return "Success!" And will start the Scrapping Engine.

## 5. Backend: Scrapping Engine ‚ú®

- It's a Dedicated set of scripts and rules to help process information from a certain source.
- Will search into the Parsed data the information of each offer and load it a cache file.
- Will search into the cached data, the exact words that the Offer Constructor needs to build the BaseModel instance.
- Will store each instance in dictionary format, with a key and value.
- Offer Constructor will take the instances created and arrange it into a Object Oriented structure to be: Shown / Exported / Sent.

## 6. Interface: Show Data ‚ú®

- I this step the app will show a message to confirm Data Processing success like this:
```
Data Processing Success!
```
- Will display the count of created Offers (instances) from data, like this:
```
{##} Instances created
```
- It could have the option to retrieve from user the number of offers to be shown, like this:
```
Please prompt the number of Offers you want to review.
./ 2
```
- If the user gives the correct int prompt, data will be displayed like this:

```
--------------------
Option 1: Offer 1
- Company:  {str}
- Position: {str}
- Salary:   {int + "cur_currency"}
--------------------
Option 2: Offer 2
- Company:  {str}
- Position: {str}
- Salary:   {int + "cur_currency"}
--------------------
...
--------------------
```
- If not, error message will be shown. And will take you back to interface.

## 7. Interface: Review Data ‚ú®

- In this step user will be able to select which Offers wants to review before exporting or sending to SQL.
- A list of Offers will be shown as data concatenated inside cards.
- Next a new prompt will be displayed at last to confirm which Offer or Offers the user needs to review.

#### This prompt will accept requests with the following syntax:
- Just 1 Option: #1
- 2 Options: #1, #2
- Specified Options: #3, #6
- Range of Options: #5 - #8
- All Options: All / # (the symbol)

#### Once prompt is done, this confirmation messsage will be shown with number of offers on review.

    You selected {##} Offers

## 8. Interface: Export or Send ‚ú®
#### Once the Job Offer info is printed, the user could choose between 4 options:

    1. Export to CSV/JSON (Interface will ask for a filename and path)
    2. Send to SQL Server (Interface will ask for Server IP and User credentials)
    3. Abort (Return to step 6: Show Data)
    4. Exit (Cleans the chache an closes the program)
